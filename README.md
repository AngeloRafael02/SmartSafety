## DISCLAIMER
The Model may have been 'overfitted' in some sense since we trained and validated the model with the same PPE equipment throughout the system's Development Phase, this repo/project is merely the proof of concept to show the effectiveness of using Machine Vision and Deep Learning to create a system that can detect if workers are using PPEs.
